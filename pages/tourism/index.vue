                  According to the State's official website, Lagos State was created on May 27, 1967 by virtue of States [Creation and Transitional Provisions] Decree No. 14 of 1967 which restructured Nigeria's Federat io n into 12 States. Prior to this, Lagos Municipality was administered as a Federal Territory by the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs as the regional authority, while the Lagos City Council governed the City of Lagos. Equally, the Metropolitan areas [Colony Province] of lkeja. Agege, Mushin, Ojo, lkorodu, Epe, and Badagry were then administered by the Western Region Government.

                <p class="tour-body1">
                  The State took off as an adm inist rat ive entity on April 11. 1968 with Lagos Island serving the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital respectively. However. with the creation of the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja in 1976, Lagos ceased to be the capital of the State, as t his was moved to lkeja.

                <p class="tour-body1">
                  Similarly, with the formal relocation of the seat of the Federal Government to Abuja on 12th December, 1991, Lagos ceased to be Nigeria's political capit al. Nevertheless, Lagos remains the nation's economic and commercial capital. According to extant political records. "Lagos is to the people of Nigeria. what the head is to the body of an individual"
